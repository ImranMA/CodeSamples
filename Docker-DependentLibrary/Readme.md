## Dockerize .NET CORE web App with dependent class library

Recently one of the challenges i faced while containerize the application was to create the docker image of my web project 
where it has dependent class library , in short more than one .csproj files. I have shared the code sample in this repo and 
you can read about it more here on my blog.
